# Introduction

Shortest Path Problem (SPP) is one of the common use-cases in spatial analysis. From finding a route to resource management, it has a wide application domain. This repository aims to improve the process of learning SPP by utilising open-source software, including the *[NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)* and *[GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/)* packages of Python. The experiments are carried out on the openly available road network dataset of *[San Francisco](https://www.kaggle.com/san-francisco/sf-list-of-streets-and-intersections)*. A Jupyter Notebook is created to facilitate the computational reproducibility of this repo. QGIS is used to visualise the dataset.

# Data Preprocess

## Converting CSV Files into a SHP file

The downloaded data is in the CSV format, which makes it difficult to visualise it on QGIS.
